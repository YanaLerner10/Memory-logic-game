description: " About The Game
PyMemory Challenge is a sweet, minimal sequence-memorization game written in Python. The concept is simple: the program shows a sequence of numbers for a short time and you must repeat it back exactly. The game grows gradually in difficulty — great for short practice sessions or demonstrating clean code structure.

Round 1: One number — easy warmup.
Round 5: Sequence gets longer and more challenging.
Round 10+: Memory workout mode!
🍭 Project Structure
File	Role	What it does
memory_logic.py	🧠 Core logic	Generates sequences, validates input, and manages rounds.
gui_game.py	💻 GUI (Tkinter)	A small, pastel-themed windowed version.
main.py	⌨️ CLI	Terminal/console playable version — good for CI/testing.
assets/	🎨 Images & CSS	(Optional) background, logo, and theme files for a web or desktop UI.
✅ Requirements
Python 3.8+
(Optional) requirements.txt — run pip install -r requirements.txt if present.
🚀 Run the Game
Desktop GUI (Tkinter)
python gui_game.py
Terminal / CLI
python main.py
⚡ Game Rules (Short)
A sequence of digits (0–9) is displayed for a few seconds.
Memorize the sequence, then type it back exactly.
Correct → next round (sequence grows). Wrong → Game Over.
