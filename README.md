## 🦄 About The Game

**PyMemory Challenge** is a super cute sequence memorization game built with Python. The concept is simple but addictive: the game shows you a sequence of numbers, and you must repeat it back exactly! 💖

* **Round 1:** One number. Easy peasy. 🌸
* **Round 5:** Five numbers. Getting harder!
* **Round 10:** ...Can you keep up?

The logic is separated entirely from the interface, designed with clean code and full type hinting.

## 🍭 Project Structure

This repository is organized into three main components:

| File | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `memory_logic.py` | **🧠 The Brain** | Contains the core game rules. It generates random sequences and checks your answers. |
| `gui_game.py` | **💻 Desktop App** | A graphical window (GUI) built with **Tkinter**. Run this to play with a visual interface. |
| `main.py` | **⌨️ CLI Game** | A terminal-based version of the game for quick testing. |

## ⚡ Game Rules

1.  **Watch:** A sequence of numbers (0-9) will appear. 👀
2.  **Memorize:** You have a few seconds to memorize them before they disappear. 💭
3.  **Repeat:** Type the sequence back exactly as it was shown.
4.  **Survive:** If you are correct, the sequence gets longer! If you fail, it's Game Over. 💔
